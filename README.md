The files contained here were produced as part of the research "Teaching and assessment of Children's Rights in Early Childhood Education teachers from an arts-based education approach", by José Carlos García-Vega, Carla Álvarez-Barrio, Silvia Capelo-Álvarez & José María Mesías-Lema.

The "posttest" and "pretest" files are encoded so that each column is named after the number of the corresponding question in the list found in "qans". The answers are encoded as 0 (wrong) and 1 (right).

The same applies to "likert_data", whose questions are listed in "lans". In this case, the answers were encoded as 1 (totally disagrees), 2 (disagrees), 3 (neither agrees nor disagrees), 4 (agrees), and 5 (totally agrees).

This should be sufficient to replicate the published calculations. If you require more information, please write to jcarlos.garcia.vega@usc.es
